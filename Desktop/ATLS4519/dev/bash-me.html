    <h1>Joanne Liu</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Currently studying my last semester of undergrad (finally!). Pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Studio Arts with a TAM minor.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>I love to snowboard and have taken every Spring Break in undergrad to do an out of state snowboarding trip!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Web Tech</h2>
    <p>I find Web Dev as a mixture of all my studies and really enjoy it as whole. I love the design aspects + quick visual feedback from the front-end in addition to the more technical code writing + logic in the back-end. I hope to become a Front-End Web Developer post graduation!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Learn</h2>
    <p>A few things I'd like to learn in this class include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sass</li>
      <li>Grid</li>
      <li>SVG - css</li>
      <li>Any industry tools/techniques overall.</li>
    </ul>
